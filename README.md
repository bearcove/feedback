# feedback for <https://fasterthanli.me>

Spotted a typo? An inaccuracy? Some article is out of date? You've somehow
updated a _whole series_ by yourself?

Then you're in the right place!

Simply [open an issue](https://github.com/bearcove/feedback/issues/new) and say
what's wrong.

I'll get to you... eventually. Thanks for caring!
